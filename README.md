# Responsive Design In Class
Today in class we will experiment with each of the following:
* Using `:hover` as a pseudo-selector.
* Using different styles with `:link`, `:visited`, and `:local-link`
* Using different relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`, `vh`, and `vw`)
* Experimenting with mobile first media queries and desktop first media queries
